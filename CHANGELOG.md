CHANGELOG
=========

[Next release](https://github.com/rebing/graphql-laravel/compare/9.1.0...master)
--------------
### Changed
- Implement lazy root types [\#1091 / sforward](https://github.com/rebing/graphql-laravel/pull/1091)

2023-08-06, 9.1.0
-----------------
## Fixed
- fix schema validation - resolve not allowed in input fields [\#1078 / crissi](https://github.com/rebing/graphql-laravel/pull/1078)

2023-06-25, 9.0.0
-----------------
## Breaking changes
### Added
- Upgrade to graphql-php 15 [\#953 / mfn](https://github.com/rebing/graphql-laravel/pull/953)\
  This includes possible breaking changes also outside of this package, see also https://github.com/webonyx/graphql-php/releases/tag/v15.0.0 \
  Known breaking changes:
  - non-standard error related data keys are not included directly in
    `errors.*.<non-standard error key>` any more, but have been moved to
    `errors.*.extensions.<non-standard error key>`.\
    Also new keys may appear here from upstream.
  - The `errors.*.extensions.category` has been removed upstream, but we try to
    keep it alive with the interface
    `\Rebing\GraphQL\Error\ProvidesErrorCategory` as it can be a useful
    discriminator on the client side in certain cases. But only the cases from
    _this_ library are preserved, e.g. categories like `request`, `graphql` or
    `internal` are gone.
  - The `\Rebing\GraphQL\Support\OperationParams` has added required types due to
    its base class changes:
    - Old: `public function getOriginalInput($key)`\
      new: `public function getOriginalInput(string $key)`
    - Old: `public function isReadOnly()`\
      new: `public function isReadOnly(): bool`
  
  Some BC may happen also if you extended code originating in graphql-php,
  some examples:
  - if you implement custom types, you now have to use property types for e.g.
    `$name` or `$description`
  - If you used any `\GraphQL\Validator\DocumentValidator` in your code
    directly, you now need use FQCN to reference them and not the shortened
    string names.
  - `->getWrappedType(true)` was replaced with `->getInnermostType()`
  - the class `\GraphQL\Type\Definition\FieldArgument` has been renamed to
    `\GraphQL\Type\Definition\Argument`

### Removed
- Remove support for eager loading (=non-lazy loading) of types\
  Lazy loading has been introduced in 2.0.0 (2019-08) and has been made the
  default since 8.0.0 (2021-11).\
  The practical impact is that types are always going to be resolved using a
  type loader and therefore cannot use aliases anymore. Types and their type
  name have to match.
- Remove integrated GraphiQL support in favour of https://github.com/mll-lab/laravel-graphiql [\#986 / mfn](https://github.com/rebing/graphql-laravel/pull/986)
- Laravel 6 is no longer supported [\#967 / mfn](https://github.com/rebing/graphql-laravel/pull/967)
- Laravel 8 is no longer supported [\#1049 / mfn](https://github.com/rebing/graphql-laravel/pull/1049)

## Changed
- The type resolver is now able to resolve the top level types 'Query',
  'Mutation' and 'Subscription'\
  If you have an existing query/mutation/type named like this, you need to
  rename it.
- Return types were added to all methods of the commands [\#1005 / sforward](https://github.com/rebing/graphql-laravel/pull/1005)
- Upgrade to laragraph/utils v2 [\#1032 / mfn](https://github.com/rebing/graphql-laravel/pull/1032)
- The `Pagination` and `SimplePagination` helper types now enforce `nonNull` on their data types
- The test suite now also runs with `--prefer-lowest` [\#1055 / mfn](https://github.com/rebing/graphql-laravel/pull/1055)\
  This uncovered a few issues with `laragraph/utils` and `webonyx/graphql-php`
  and thus their minimum version had to be slightly bumped to `2.0.1` and
  `15.0.3` respectively.

### Removed
- Remove unused publish command [\#1004 / sforward](https://github.com/rebing/graphql-laravel/pull/1004)
  A leftover from the Lumen removal yers ago (#772)

2023-02-18, 8.6.0

- Allow using addSelect() in relationship query scopes [\#875 / codercms](https://github.com/rebing/graphql-laravel/pull/806)

### Removed

2022-01-30, 8.2.1
-----------------
### Fixed
- Fix schema parsing issue when route prefix is empty string [\#890 / hello-liang-shan](https://github.com/rebing/graphql-laravel/pull/890)\
  Note: this is a follow-up fix to #888

2022-01-27, 8.2.0
-----------------
### Fixed

2022-01-15, 8.1.0
-----------------
### Added
- Support for Laravel 9 [\#879 / mfn](https://github.com/rebing/graphql-laravel/pull/879)

2021-11-15, 8.0.0
-----------------

## Breaking changes
- Rewrite and simplify how schemas are handled
  - `\Rebing\GraphQL\GraphQL::$schemas` now only holds `Schema`s and not a
    mixture of strings or arrays
  - `\Rebing\GraphQL\GraphQL::schema()` now only accepts a "schema name", but no
    ad hoc `Schema` or "schema configs". To use ad hoc schemas, use
    `\Rebing\GraphQL\GraphQL::buildSchemaFromConfig()` and
    `\Rebing\GraphQL\GraphQL::addSchema()`
  - `\Rebing\GraphQL\GraphQL::queryAndReturnResult()` (and thus also
    `\Rebing\GraphQL\GraphQL::query()`) does not accept ad hoc schemas via
    `$opts['schema']` anymore; it now only can reference a schema via its name.
  - `\Rebing\GraphQL\GraphQL::addSchema()` now only accept `Schema` objects,
    where before it would support ad hoc schemas via array configuration.
    Use `\Rebing\GraphQL\GraphQL::buildSchemaFromConfig()` for that now.
  - `\Rebing\GraphQL\GraphQL::getSchemaConfiguration()` has been removed due to
    the simplifications.
  - `\Rebing\GraphQL\GraphQL::getNormalizedSchemaConfiguration()` does not
    support ad hoc schemas anymore and only accepts the schema name.
  - `\Rebing\GraphQL\GraphQLServiceProvider::bootSchemas()` has been removed due
    to the simplifications.
    
- The following methods now take a `\Illuminate\Contracts\Config\Repository` as
  second argument:
  - `\Rebing\GraphQL\GraphQL::__construct`
  - `\Rebing\GraphQL\GraphQLServiceProvider::applySecurityRules`
- As part of moving the architecture to an execution based middleware approach,
  the following methods have been removed:
  - `\Rebing\GraphQL\GraphQLController::handleAutomaticPersistQueries` has been
    replaced by the `AutomaticPersistedQueriesMiddleware` middleware
  - `\Rebing\GraphQL\GraphQLController::queryContext` has been
    replaced by the `AddAuthUserContextValueMiddleware` middleware\
    If you relied on overriding `queryContext` to inject a custom context, you
    now need to create your own execution middleware and add to your
    configuration
  - `\Rebing\GraphQL\GraphQLController::executeQuery` has become obsolete, no
    direct replacement.

- Routing has been rewritten and simplified [\#757 / mfn](https://github.com/rebing/graphql-laravel/pull/757)
  - All routing related configuration is now within the top level `route`
    configuration key
  - The following configuration options have been removed:
    - `graphql.routes`\
      It's therefore also not possible anymore to register different routes for
      queries and mutations within a schema. Each schema gets only one route
      (except for the default schema, which is registered for the global prefix
      route as well as under its name).\
      If necessary, this can be emulated with different schemas and multi-level
      paths
  - The following configuration options have been moved/renamed:
    - `graphql.prefix` => `graphql.route.prefix`
    - `graphql.controllers` => `graphql.route.controller`\
      Further, providing a controller action for `query` or `mutation` is not
      supported anymore.
    - `graphql.middleware` => `graphql.route.middleware`
    - `graphql.route_group_attributes` => `graphql.route.group_attributes`
  - The actual routes defined have changed:
    - No more separate routes for the HTTP methods
    - 1 route for each schema + 1 route for the group prefix (default schema)
    - If GraphiQL is enabled: 1 route graphiql route for each schema + 1 for the
      graphiql group prefix (default schema)
    - If provided, the `'method'` argument **must** provide the HTTP method
      verbs in uppercase like `POST` or `GET`, `post` or `get` will **not** work.
  - It's now possible to prevent the registering of any routes by making the top
    level `route` an empty array or null
  - `\Rebing\GraphQL\GraphQL::routeNameTransformer` has been removed
  - It's now possible to register schemas with a `-` in their name
  - Routes are now properly cacheable

- Remove the `\Rebing\GraphQL\GraphQLController::$app`  property [\#755 / mfn](https://github.com/rebing/graphql-laravel/pull/755)\
  Injecting the application container early is incompatible when running within
  an application server like laravel/octane, as it's not guaranteed that the
  container received contains all the bindings. If you relied on this property
  when extending the classes, invoke the container directly via
  `Container::getInstance()`.
  
- Remove deprecated `\Rebing\GraphQL\Support\Type::$inputObject` and `\Rebing\GraphQL\Support\Type::$enumObject` properties [\#752 / mfn](https://github.com/rebing/graphql-laravel/pull/752)\
  Instead in your code, extend `\Rebing\GraphQL\Support\InputType` and `\Rebing\GraphQL\Support\EnumType` directly 
  
- Support for Lumen has been removed
  
- Integrate laragraph/utils RequestParser [\#739 / mfn](https://github.com/rebing/graphql-laravel/pull/739)\
  The parsing of GraphQL requests is now more strict:
  - if you send a `GET` request, the GraphQL query has to be in the query parameters
  - if you send a `POST` request, the GraphQL query needs to be in the body\
    Mixing of either isn't possible anymore
  - batched queries will only work with `POST` requests
    This is due to `RequestParser` using `\GraphQL\Server\Helper::parseRequestParams` which includes this check
  Further:  
  - Drop support for configuration the name of the variable for the variables (`params_key`)
  - `GraphQLUploadMiddleware` has been removed (`RequestParser` includes this functionality)
  - Empty GraphQL queries now return a proper validated GraphQL error
      
- In `\Rebing\GraphQL\GraphQL`, renamed remaining instances of `$params` to `$variables`    
  After switching to `RequestParser`, the support for changing the variable name
  what was supposed to `params_key` has gone and thus the name isn't fitting anymore.
  Also, the default value for `$variables` has been changed to `null` to better
  fit the how `OperationParams` works:
  - old: `public function query(string $query, ?array $params = [], array $opts = []): array`
    new: `public function query(string $query, ?array $variables = null, array $opts = []): array`
  - old: `public function queryAndReturnResult(string $query, ?array $params = [], array $opts = []): ExecutionResult`
    new: `public function queryAndReturnResult(string $query, ?array $variables = null, array $opts = []): ExecutionResult`

  - `\Rebing\GraphQL\Support\ResolveInfoFieldsAndArguments` has been removed
  - `$getSelectFields` closure no longer takes a depth parameter

- The `$args` argument, of the `handle` method of the execution middlewares requires `array` as type.  

### Added
- Command to make an execution middleware [\#772 / mfn](https://github.com/rebing/graphql-laravel/pull/772)
- Command to make a schema configuration [\#830 / matsn0w](https://github.com/rebing/graphql-laravel/pull/830)
- The primary execution of the GraphQL request is now piped through middlewares [\#762 / crissi and mfn](https://github.com/rebing/graphql-laravel/pull/762)\
  This allows greater flexibility for enabling/disabling certain functionality
  as well as bringing in new features without having to open up the library.
- Primarily register \Rebing\GraphQL\GraphQL as service and keep `'graphql'` as alias [\#768 / mfn](https://github.com/rebing/graphql-laravel/pull/768)
- Automatic Persisted Queries (APQ) now cache the parsed query [\#740 / mfn](https://github.com/rebing/graphql-laravel/pull/740)\
  This avoids having to re-parse the same queries over and over again.
- Add ability to detect unused GraphQL variables [\#660 / mfn](https://github.com/rebing/graphql-laravel/pull/660)
- Laravel's `ValidationException` is now formatted the same way as a `ValidationError` [\#748 / mfn](https://github.com/rebing/graphql-laravel/pull/748)
- A few missing typehints (mostly array related) [\#849 / mfn](https://github.com/rebing/graphql-laravel/pull/849)

### Changed
- Internally webonyx query plan feature is now used for retrieving information about a query [\#793 / crissi](https://github.com/rebing/graphql-laravel/pull/793))
- Rewrite and simplify how schemas are handled [\#779 / mfn](https://github.com/rebing/graphql-laravel/pull/779)
- Internally stop using the global `config()` function and preferable use the repository or the Facade otherwise [\#774 / mfn](https://github.com/rebing/graphql-laravel/pull/774)
- Don't silence broken schemas when normalizing them for generating routes [\#766 / mfn](https://github.com/rebing/graphql-laravel/pull/766)
- Lazy loading types has been enabled by default [\#758 / mfn](https://github.com/rebing/graphql-laravel/pull/758)
- Make it easier to extend select fields [\#799 / crissi](https://github.com/rebing/graphql-laravel/pull/799)
- The `$args` argument, of the `handle` method of the execution middlewares requires `array` as type [\#843 / sforward](https://github.com/rebing/graphql-laravel/pull/843)
- Embrace thecodingmachine/safe and use thecodingmachine/phpstan-safe-rule to enforce it [\#851 / mfn](https://github.com/rebing/graphql-laravel/pull/851)
- Don't require a return value for the query option of fields [\#856 / sforward](https://github.com/rebing/graphql-laravel/pull/856)

### Fixed
- Fix `TypeNotFound` when an interface defined after another type where it is used [\#828 / kasian-sergeev](https://github.com/rebing/graphql-laravel/pull/828)

### Removed
- The method `\Rebing\GraphQL\GraphQLServiceProvider::provides` was removed [\#769 / mfn](https://github.com/rebing/graphql-laravel/pull/769)\
  It's only relevant for deferred providers which ours however isn't (and can't
  be made into with the current Laravel architecture).

- The order and arguments/types for resolvers has changed:
  - before: `resolve($root, $array, SelectFields $selectFields, ResolveInfo $info)`
  - after: `resolve($root, $array, $context, ResolveInfo $info, Closure $getSelectFields)`
- Added PHP types / phpdoc to all methods / properties [\#331](https://github.com/rebing/graphql-laravel/pull/331)
  - Changes in method signatures will require small adaptions.
- Validation errors are moved from `error.validation` to `error.extensions.validation` as per GraphQL spec recommendation [\#294](https://github.com/rebing/graphql-laravel/pull/294)
- SelectFields on interface types now only selects specific fields instead of all [\#294](https://github.com/rebing/graphql-laravel/pull/294)
  - Although this could be considered a bug fix, it changes what columns are selected and if your code as a side effect dependent on all columns being selected, it will break

### Added
- Added support for lazy loading types (config `lazyload_types`), improve performance on large type systems [\#405](https://github.com/rebing/graphql-laravel/pull/405) but doesn't work together with type aliases or `paginate()`.
- A migration guide for the Folklore library as part of the readme
- New `make:graphql:input` command
- New `make:graphql:union` command
- New `make:graphql:interface` command
- New `make:graphql:field` command
- New `make:graphql:enum` command and dedicated `EnumType`, deprecating `$enumObject=true` in the `Type` class
- New `make:graphql:scalar` command and add more information regarding scalars to the readme
- `TypeConvertible` interface requiring to implement `toType(): \GraphQL\Type\Definition\Type`
  Existing types are not affected because they already made use of the same method/signature, but custom Scalar GraphQL types work differently and benefit from the interface
- `alias` is now also supported for relationships [\#367](https://github.com/rebing/graphql-laravel/pull/367)
- `InputType` support class which eventually replace `$inputObject=true` [\#363](https://github.com/rebing/graphql-laravel/pull/363)
- Support `DB::raw()` in `alias` fields
- GraphiQL: use regenerated CSRF from server if present [\#332](https://github.com/rebing/graphql-laravel/pull/332)
- Internal
  - Added declare(strict_types=1) directive to all files
  - Test suite has been refactored and now features Database (SQLite) tests too

### Changed
- Types and Schemas are now only booted when the `graphql` service is requested, improving performance when having this library installed but not using it in certain workloads (pure artisan commands, non-GraphQL web requests, etc.) [\#427](https://github.com/rebing/graphql-laravel/pull/427)
- Follow Laravel convention and use plural for namespaces (e.g. new queries are placed in `App\GraphQL\Queries`, not `App\GraphQL\Query` anymore); make commands have been adjusted
- Made the following classes _abstract_: `Support\Field`, `Support\InterfaceType`, `Support\Mutation`, `Support\Query`, `Support\Type`, `Support\UnionType` [\#357](https://github.com/rebing/graphql-laravel/pull/357)
- Updated GraphiQL to 0.13.0 [\#335](https://github.com/rebing/graphql-laravel/pull/335)
  - If you're using CSP, be sure to allow `cdn.jsdelivr.net` and `cdnjs.cloudflare.com`
- `ValidatorError`: remove setter and make it a constructor arg, add getter and rely on contracts
- Replace global helper `is_lumen` with static class call `\Rebing\GraphQL\Helpers::isLumen`

### Fixed
- The Paginator correctly inherits the types model so it can be used with `SelectFields` and still generates correct SQL queries [\#415](https://github.com/rebing/graphql-laravel/pull/415)
- Arguments are now validated before they're passed to `authorize()` [\#413](https://github.com/rebing/graphql-laravel/pull/413)
- File uploads now correctly work with batched requests [\#397](https://github.com/rebing/graphql-laravel/pull/397)
- Path multi-level support for Schemas works again [\#358](https://github.com/rebing/graphql-laravel/pull/358)
- SelectFields correctly passes field arguments to the custom query [\#327](https://github.com/rebing/graphql-laravel/pull/327)
  - This also applies to privacy checks on fields, the callback now receives the field arguments too
  - Previously the initial query arguments would be used everywhere

### Removed
- Removed `\Fluent` dependency on `\Rebing\GraphQL\Support\Field` [\#431](https://github.com/rebing/graphql-laravel/pull/431)
- Removed `\Fluent` dependency on `\Rebing\GraphQL\Support\Type` [\#389](https://github.com/rebing/graphql-laravel/pull/389)
- Unused static field `\Rebing\GraphQL\Support\Type::$instances`
- Unused field `\Rebing\GraphQL\Support\Type::$unionType`
